# Lab2

 Project Overview
Build a library system where:
The library can have Books, magazines and Journals.
Some types of items can be loaned and some are only for reading at library.
Users (Members : Students, Professors) can borrow and return different types of Library items.
Books have categories (Fiction, Non-fiction, Academic).
A loan management system keeps track of issued books.
Implement features like late fees and borrowing limits.

Milestone A : Represent User structure
Create the Base User Class
Add Constructors to User
Create a Subclass Member
Create a Subclass Librarian
Implement generateUniqueId using Static and Final Concepts

Task 1: Create the Base User Class
Objective: Introduce abstract classes, encapsulation, and basic object-oriented principles.
Step 1.1: Define a class User with the following private attributes:
String userId
String name
String contactInfo
Step 1.2: Add getter and setter methods for name and contactInfo.
Challenge: Use encapsulation by keeping attributes private and accessing them through getters/setters.



Task 2: Add Constructors to User
Objective: Explore constructors (default, parameterized, and copy).
Step 2.1: Implement:
A default constructor that initializes userId using generateUniqueId method (We can return 0 from this method for now )
A parameterized constructor that initializes name and contactInfo.
A copy constructor that copies attributes from another User.
Step 2.2: Test constructors by creating instances using all three constructors in a test class.

Task 3: Make User an Abstract Class
Objective: Understand the concept of abstract classes and polymorphism.
Step 3.1: Mark User as abstract and declare the following abstract methods:
void displayDashboard()
boolean canBorrowBooks()
Step 3.2: Explain why these methods are abstract and how they enable polymorphism.

Task 4: Create a Subclass Member
Objective: Implement inheritance and method overriding.
Step 4.1: Create a concrete subclass Member that extends User.
Step 4.2: Add the following private attributes:
int borrowedBooksCount
A constant MAX_BORROW_LIMIT = 5
Step 4.3: Override the abstract methods:
displayDashboard() should display Member Dashboard and Books Borrowed: X.
canBorrowBooks() should return true if borrowedBooksCount < MAX_BORROW_LIMIT.
Step 4.4: Add constructors to initialize Member.

Task 5: Create a Subclass Librarian
Objective: Implement additional subclass-specific functionality.
Step 5.1: Create a subclass Librarian that extends User.
Step 5.2: Add the private attribute String employeeNumber.
Step 5.3: Override the abstract methods:
displayDashboard() should display Librarian Dashboard and the employeeNumber.
canBorrowBooks() should always return true.  
Step 5.4: Add methods for librarian-specific actions:
void addNewBook(Book book)
void removeBook(Book book)
Leave implementations as comments for now.

Task 6: Demonstrate Static and Final Concepts
Objective: Understand static and final concepts with practical use.
Resource for Static : https://www.scaler.com/topics/static-keyword-in-java/
Resource for Final : https://www.scaler.com/topics/java/final-keyword-in-java/

Step 6.1: Add a static counter totalUsers and a method getTotalUsers() to track the total number of users.
Challenge: Use a static variable to maintain state across instances.
Step 6.2: Write a generateUniqueId() method to create unique user IDs. Mark this method as final to prevent overriding.
Step 6.3: Verify that:
The generateUniqueId method cannot be overridden in subclasses.
The totalUsers counter accurately tracks the number of users.

Task 1: Create the Lendable Interface
Objective: Introduce interfaces and compile-time polymorphism.
Step 1.1: Define the Lendable interface with the following methods:
boolean lend(User user)
void returnBook(User user)
boolean isAvailable()
Step 1.2: Explain the purpose of interfaces and how they enable compile-time polymorphism.
Step 1.3: Create a basic test class to simulate borrowing a book by defining a dummy class that implements Lendable.

Task 2: Implement the Abstract Book Class
Objective: Explore abstract classes, encapsulation, and method overriding.
Step 2.1: Create the Book class that implements Lendable. Add the following private attributes:
String isbn
String title
String author
boolean isAvailable
Step 2.2: Implement the methods from Lendable:
lend(User user): If the book is available and the user can borrow, mark the book as unavailable and return true.
returnBook(User user): Mark the book as available.
isAvailable(): Return the availability status.
Step 2.3: Explain why the class is abstract and add an abstract method void displayBookDetails().




Task 3: Add Constructors to the Book Class
Objective: Practice constructor overloading and copying.
Step 3.1: Add the following constructors:
A default constructor that initializes isAvailable to true.
A parameterized constructor to initialize isbn, title, and author.
A copy constructor to create a new Book object from an existing one.
Step 3.2: Test the constructors by creating objects using each constructor.

Task 4: Create TextBook Class
Objective: Demonstrate inheritance and method implementation.
Step 4.1: Define the TextBook class as a subclass of Book with the following additional attributes:
String subject
int edition
Step 4.2: Add a parameterized constructor to initialize all attributes, including those inherited from Book.
Step 4.3: Override displayBookDetails() to display the textbook's details.
Step 4.4: Test the TextBook class by creating an object and calling its methods.

Task 5: Create NovelBook Class
Objective: Implement another concrete subclass to explore different book types.
Step 5.1: Define the NovelBook class as a subclass of Book with the additional attribute:
String genre
Step 5.2: Add a parameterized constructor to initialize all attributes, including those inherited from Book.
Step 5.3: Override displayBookDetails() to display the novel's details.
Step 5.4: Test the NovelBook class by creating an object and calling its methods.

Task 1: Set Up Collections
Objective: Understand and implement collections to manage system-wide data.
Step 1.1: Create a class LibraryManagementSystem with:
A List<Book> named bookInventory to store all books.
A List<User> named registeredUsers to store all registered users.
Step 1.2: Explain the purpose of using collections
Step 1.3: Add methods:
addBook(Book book) to add a book to bookInventory.
registerUser(User user) to add a user to registeredUsers.
Step 1.4: Test the collections by adding a few books and users, then print their details.

Task 2: Implement Search Functionality
Objective: Demonstrate compile-time polymorphism through method overloading.
Step 2.1: Add a static method searchBooks(String criteria) to search for books by title or author. Use a loop to iterate over bookInventory and add matching books to a result list.
Step 2.2: Overload searchBooks with additional parameters:
searchBooks(String criteria, String type) for searching books of a specific type ("TextBook" or "NovelBook").
Implement this method to filter results based on the type of book.
Java Enums
Step 2.3: Test the overloaded methods with different inputs and ensure they return correct results.

Task 3: Integrate Book and User Management
Objective: Combine book and user features to demonstrate system functionality.
Step 3.1: In the main method:
Create a few instances of TextBook and NovelBook.
Add these books to the library using addBook.
Step 3.2: Create instances of Member and Librarian.
Register them using registerUser.
Step 3.3: Print the details of all books and users to verify the inventory and registration system.

Task 4: Demonstrate Lending Functionality
Objective: Practice the interaction between users and books.
Step 4.1: Simulate lending a book:
Attempt to lend a TextBook to a Member using the lend(User user) method.
Print a success message if the lending operation is successful.
Step 4.2: Add logic to handle the following scenarios:
A user attempts to borrow a book that is already lent.
A user exceeds their borrowing limit.
Step 4.3: Test lending with different types of books and users.

Task 5: Manage Returns
Objective: Complete the book borrowing cycle.
Step 5.1: Simulate returning a book:
Use the returnBook(User user) method to mark a book as available again.
Step 5.2: Ensure the book can be lent to another user after it is returned.
Step 5.3: Test the return functionality by printing the availability status of books before and after returning.

Task 6: Advanced Features
Objective: Explore additional features to extend the system.
Step 6.1: Add a method displayAllBooks to print the details of all books in bookInventory.
Step 6.2: Add a method displayRegisteredUsers to print the details of all users in registeredUsers.
Step 6.3: Demonstrate searching:
Search for books by title or author using searchBooks.
Search for books by type using the overloaded method.
